# Ubuntu 18.04 Setup Instructions

#### 1) Download Chrome Web Browser

We will be using tools included in Chrome web browser throughout the course so please ensure you have this downloaded and ideally set to your default web browser.

[Click here to Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

#### 2) Download Slack Desktop

We use Slack as our main communication tool so it's really worth having the desktop version, which can be downloaded [here](https://slack.com/downloads/linux). Choose the .deb version.

If you have any problems with the above download, an alternative way to download Slack is by running the following command in your terminal

```
sudo snap install slack --classic
```

We would also recommend downloading it on your phone, so you can let us know if you happen to be running late etc.

#### 3) Get a Github account

Github is a collaboration platform for developers. We will be using it to give you access to course material, and you'll use it to host and share your code.

It is also the place prospective employers often look to see evidence of projects you've worked on.

Sign up to a free account [here](https://github.com) and make sure to email james.heggs@techreturners.com and harriet.ryder@techreturners.com your username so we can add you to our organisation.

#### 4) Download Zoom

We might use Zoom to host webinars, so sign up and download [Zoom here](https://zoom.us/meetings).

#### 5) Download Visual Studio Code

When writing software, developers use tools to help them. One of those tools is known as an Integrated Development Environment or IDE for short. This is a tool that helps the developer when writing code.

You use an IDE to write software in the same way that you might use Microsoft Word to produce a document.

On this course we use a tool called Visual Studio Code to support our writing of code. So firstly head over to their website to [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Select the .deb version for Linux x64.

#### 6) Install Terminator

Ubuntu comes with a built in terminal application (also referred to as _command line_ or _console_). We use the terminal to navigate and manipulate our filesystem, run commands and provide a more powerful interface than the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for interacting with our computer.

However, there are better applications available with more features than the default one. We recommend downloading and using [Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html).

To install Terminator open your current terminal program and run the following commands, in order:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome-terminator
```

```
sudo apt-get update
```

```
sudo apt-get install terminator
```

Terminator should now be installed and ready to use.

#### 7) Install Node

The next item to install is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node provides the Javascript framework for running our code and applications.

When you install Node it also installs [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (NPM for short). Node Package Manager (NPM) is a piece of software that allows you to install other Javascript packages that have been created by the global software development community.

The packages contain code written by other people and have been made available for everyone to use. Making your code available to the global community is a practice known as [Open Sourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) your software.

For example - lets say you want to convert a number to its English description. Convert the number **100** to its description of **one hundred**. In programming terms this is harder than you might expect - however someone has already [created a piece of code that does this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/number-to-words) and it saves us from having to write our own code to solve this problem. Effectively, leaving us to focus on writing code for our own unique problems and businesses.

To install Node run the following commands in your terminal (Terminator) in the following order:

```
sudo apt update
```

```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

You should now see a lot of text on your console as Node gets installed. You can verify that node is installed by running:

```
nodejs --version
```

It should output something similar to the example below. NOTE: The version you see might differ to the example below. If it is below 8.0.0 please let one of us know!

```
v8.11.1
```

Ensure NPM is installed by typing:

```
npm --version
```

If the output tells you the version is below 5.0.0 please let us know!

#### 8) Install Git

Git is a [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (VCS for short). At this stage don't worry too much about what Git is or what it does, we cover Version Control Systems and Git in more detail later. For now we just need to make sure it is installed on your laptop.

To install Git run the following commands in order in your terminal:

```
sudo apt update
```

```
sudo apt install git
```

You can check that git is installed by running:

```
git --version
```

It should output something similar to:

```
git version 2.11.0
```

#### 9) Configure Git

When using Git, messages about what changes you have made to a codebase will be recorded using your name and email address. For this to work correctly, you should configure Git with your name and email address. You should choose the email address which you used to sign up to Github, so that Git and Github integrate correctly. Open your terminal application and type the fo

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

```
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```

To see that the above steps worked correctly, type:

```
git config --list
```

and you should see your name and email outputted in the following format:

```
user.name=Your Name
user.email=youremail@domain.com
```

#### 10) Get a notetaking app

Throughout the course you will probably want to take lots of notes, often with code samples. Microsoft Word/Apple Pages are not good choices for this kind of notetaking as they won't format your code correctly and will try to autocomplete in an annoying way.

We recommend downloading a notetaking app which supports Markdown and inline code.

Examples are:

[SimpleNote](https://simplenote.com/?)

[BoostNote](https://boostnote.io/)

There are also more paid options but one of the above is a good start.

Congratulations, your laptop is now good to go ðŸŽ‰

If you've finished in mega-speedy time and you don't want to go home yet, take a look at the [Codecademy course on the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) and start getting used to using your new terminal application (Terminator).
